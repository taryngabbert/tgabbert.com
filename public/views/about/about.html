			<h1>about me.</h1>
			<h4>I am a web developer/fashion blogger based out of Dallas, TX.</h4>
			I graduated from University of Texas at Dallas from the <a href="http://jindal.utdallas.edu/undergraduate-programs/honors-program/">Davidson Management Honors Program </a> in 2015 with a BA in Global Business and Finance. After graduation I worked for United Capital Financial Advisers, when I was put on a project that spurred my interest in Web Development. My interest turned into a passion, and I decided I had to know more. A year after starting in Finance, I made a giant leap and went to <a href="https://devmountain.com/web-immersive">DevMountain</a>, an intensive three month bootcamp, to learn all the ins-and-outs of how to build web applications. <br><br>
			Now, having graduated DevMountain, I am currently working for them as a mentor for their current student class. I work primarily in JavaScript. On the front end I know AngularJS and React. Backend Node.js and can build database systems with noSQL. <br><br>
